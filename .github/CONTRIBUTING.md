# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the project! Please take a moment to review this document **before submitting a pull request**.

## Pull requests

**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create [an issue](https://github.com/vicgutt/tailwindcss-opinionated-preset/issues) to first discuss any significant new features.

## Coding standards

Our code formatting rules are defined in [.prettierrc.json](https://github.com/vicgutt/tailwindcss-opinionated-preset/blob/main/.prettierrc.json). You can check your code against these standards by running:

```sh
npm run format
```

To automatically fix any style violations in your code, you can run:

```sh
npm run format:fix
```
